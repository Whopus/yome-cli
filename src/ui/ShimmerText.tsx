// ShimmerText — animated text with a moving gradient highlight.
//
// Each character picks its color based on (frame - charIndex) mod period,
// so a "shine" appears to sweep left → right across the word. The
// gradient palette is a ramp from the brand orange through bright
// yellow to a near-white peak and back, which reads as a soft
// "streaming" highlight in the terminal.
//
// Costs nothing extra in timer overhead — uses the shared frame driver.

// Two-tone ramp: brand orange → white → orange. Linear interpolation
// from #E87B35 to #FFFFFF and back. The peak (#FFFFFF) is the moving
// "spot light" sweeping across the word; everything else is just an
// orange-to-white gradient with no extra hues.
//
// Ink uses chalk under the hood, which supports truecolor in modern
// terminals, so any hex value works.
